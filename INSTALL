    Perl Modules

        There are no non-standard Perl modules required by this module.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL file
    and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    Normally when Makefile.PL is run it will run Configure which will ask some
    questions about your system.  The results of these questions will be stored
    in a file called libnet.cfg which will be installed alongside the other perl
    modules in this distribution.  Makefile.PL will run Configure in an
    interactive mode unless these exists a file called libnet.cfg in the build
    directory or Makefile.PL itself is being run non-interactively or via cpan,
    cpanp or cpanm.

    If you are on a system which cannot run this script you can create an empty
    file to make Makefile.PL skip running Configure.  If you want to keep your
    existing settings and not run interactivly then simply run:

        perl Configure -d

    before running Makefile.PL.

    Use the appropriate program name instead of "make" in the above commands if
    your perl was built with a different make program.  To determine which make
    program was used to build your perl type the following:

        perl -V:make
