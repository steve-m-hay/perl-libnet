Revision history for Perl distribution libnet

3.06 Development

    - Fixed Net::FTP authorize() method, which incorrectly interpreted the
      return value of the _RESP() method and falsely reported a failure.  [Troy
      Loveday, CPAN RT#48532]

    - Added optional SendHello argument to Net::SMTP->new() to allow preventing
      the EHLO/HELO command from being automatically sent by the constructor.
      [Danil Onishchenko, PR#13]

3.05 2015-01-12

    - Fixed infinite loop in Net::SMTP::auth().  [CPAN RT#100235]

3.04 2014-11-29

    - SNI is now only used for SSL connections if it is supported by
      IO::Socket::SSL (i.e. OpenSSL version >= 1).  (The previous release
      switched to using SNI by default, which caused some CPAN Testers
      failures.)  [Steffen Ullrich, PR#10]

3.03 2014-11-28

    - Remodelled SSL support in Net::NNTP in the manner of Net::POP3 and
      Net::SMTP.  [Steffen Ullrich, PR#9]

    - Increased minimum requred IO::Socket::SSL version from 1.999 to 2.007 to
      fix data connection problems in Net::FTP.  [Steffen Ullrich, CPAN
      RT#100529]

    - Fixed a broken port() call in pasv_xfer()/pasv_xfer_unique() in Net::FTP.
      [Mario Preksavec, PR#8]

    - Increased minimum required Socket version from 1.3 to 2.016.  This may be
      required when those modules that can support IPv6 load IO::Socket::IP (on
      some OSes, at least).  It does not appear to be necessary if they load
      IO::Socket::INET6 or IO::Socket::INET instead, but this is not easy for
      the end-user to control so it is simpler to always insist on Socket 2.016
      or higher.  [CPAN RT#100020]

    - Fixed "Argument ... isn't numeric in subroutine entry" warnings when using
      older versions of Perl.  [CPAN RT#100020]

    - Added optional Changes testing (skipped unless AUTHOR_TESTING).

    - Reformatted Changes file as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.

3.02 2014-10-10

    - Don't run interactive prompt() in Makefile.PL when in PERL_CORE.

    - Fix $smtp->auth($sasl) to try the AUTH mechanism (if present) in the
      Authen::SASL object before falling back on other mechanisms.  [CPAN
      RT#99415]

3.01 2014-10-09

    - Require IO::Socket::SSL >= 1.999 to protect against a bad version (0.30)
      of IO::Socket::IP and hopefully fix another bunch of CPAN Testers
      failures.

3.00 2014-10-09

    - Skip Perl Critic, Pod and Pod Coverage tests unless AUTHOR_TESTING.  [CPAN
      RT#99399]

    - Synchronize all $VERSIONs to the distribution's version number, bumping
      that to 3.00 so that no $VERSIONs end up going backwards.

1.30 2014-10-08

    - Sigh. Fix PAUSE indexing problem again. Net::SMTP::SSL is already used by
      Net-SMTP-SSL.

1.29 2014-10-08

    - Fix PAUSE indexing problem. Net::POP3::_SSLified and Net::SMTP::_SSLified
      are already used by Net-SSLGlue.

1.28 2014-10-08

    - Improve code()/message() initialization and error handling in Net::Cmd.
      [Tom Metro, CPAN RT#14875]

    - Don't use the ALLO command on FTP servers that don't support it.  [CPAN
      RT#95717]

    - Stop Makefile.PL from requiring interactive configuration when running via
      cpan, cpanp or cpanm: just accept all defaults in these cases, as when
      running non-interactively.  [CPAN RT#48966]

    - Add optional POD coverage testing.

    - Add optional POD testing.

    - Add optional Perl::Critic testing.

    - Make code Perl::Critic clean.

    - Move Net/*.pm into lib/Net/ sub-directory within distribution.  This is
      the usual layout style these days.

    - Change Net::SMTP::auth() so that it now falls back to another supported
      AUTH method if a given AUTH method fails.  [Ivan Baktsheev, PR#3]

    - Change Net::SMTP::auth() so that it uses the SMTP AUTH mechanism(s)
      specified in the Authen::SASL object if one is provided instead of a
      username.   If a plain text username is specified then use the first
      reported SMTP AUTH method supported, as usual.  [Ewen McNeill, CPAN
      RT#58002]

    - Add support for IPv6 and SSL to Net::FTP, Net::NNTP, Net::POP3 and
      Net::SMTP.  These features are only available if the user has:

      * a recent IO::Socket::SSL for SSL support;

      * a recent IO::Socket::IP or an older IO::Socket::INET6 for IPv6 support.

      If no SSL module is available it will work as before, but attempts to use
      the SSL functionality will result in an error message.  If no IPv6 modules
      are available it will just use IPv4 as before.  With IPv6 modules
      installed one can of course still access IPv4 hosts.  [Steffen Ullrich,
      CPAN RT#93823]

1.27 2014-05-30

    - Simplified Makefile.PL requirements.

1.26 2014-05-30

    - Set minimum required ExtUtils::MakeMaker version to 6.64 to ensure that
      all parameters used are supported, to save jumping through hoops to
      support earlier versions.  (This should not be a problem since
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.64 is easily installed into Perl 5.8.1 and above,
      that being the whole point of the new choice of minimum supported Perl
      version.)

    - Set minimum required Perl version to 5.8.1.  This is in line with the
      minimum requirement of the "Perl Toolchain".

1.25 2014-02-04

    - Fix Net::FTP::pasv_wait() not handling errors from Net::Cmd::reponse().
      [bergner@cs.umu.se, CPAN RT#50420]

    - Make inheritance from Net::Cmd clearer in the documentation.  [CPAN
      RT#72889]

    - Set timeout for data connection creation in Net::FTP.  [Oleg G, CPAN
      RT#78926]

    - Stop Net::Domain::domainname() from giving out warnings in Android.
      [Brian Fraser]

1.24 2014-01-06

    - Fix incorrect handling of CRLF in Net::FTP.  [Willem Monsuwé, CPAN
      RT#41642/62029]

    - POD fixes.  [Dominic Hargreaves, CPAN RT#91761]

1.23 2013-08-12

    - Typo fixes.  [David Steinbrunner, CPAN RT#87681]

1.22_02 2013-08-08

    - Make Net::FTP::dataconn::close() more robust.  [Together with changes to
      Net::FTP already made in 1.22_01, this resolves CPAN RT#37700.]

    - Document scalar/list context return values from Net::Cmd::message().

    - Fix broken URL.  [CPAN RT#68749]

    - Fix documentation typo in Net::Netrc.

    - Fix broken POD in Net::POP3.

    - Improve Net::SMTP documentation of new(), auth() and message().  [CPAN
      RT#36038]

    - Add proper skips to skipped tests in ftp.t.

    - Import hostname.t fix from Perl core commit #adeb94125a.

    - Add time.t, imported from Perl core commit #c85707204c.

    - Add new maintainer information, with updated CPAN and GitHub links.

1.22_01 2010-05-31 09:40:25-05:00

    - Do not create/pass a remote name if one is not given to put_unique.

    - Add ->passive() method to switch between PORT/PASV connections.

    - Accept - in command parsed from SMTP HELO response.

    - Allow group to set to a group named "0".

    - Set $@ when ->new() returns undef.

    - Add support for LocalAddr to be passed to ->new().

    - Document that timeout is in seconds.

    - Fix leading . encoding in datasend().

    - Make ->supported() check ->feature().

    - Allow words other than FILE to prefix the unique name returned in info
      message from stou.

    - Send ALLO command just before the store command.

    - Avoid warnings when server do not prefix messages with codes.

    - Use uppercase characters for xtext encoding.

    - Catch timeout condition while doing an abort.

    - Ensure REST is sent directly before command being restarted.

    - Fix URL.  [Leon Brocard, CPAN RT#49920]

    - Avoid long hang on Mac OS X when hostname is *.local by not calling
      gethostbyname().  [Father Chrysostomos]

    - Avoid infinite recursion in rmdir().

    - Allow finding _netrc on machines that do not support .netrc.  [Ben Bimber]

    - Fixed bug that a restarted get with Net::FTP did not append to local file.

1.18 2004-03-22 16:19:01Z

[Bug Fixes]

    - Fixed bug in CRLF translation in Net::Cmd datasend()/dataend() methods.

      which can be used instead of passing the host as the first argument.

    - Added ->host() method to FTP, NNTP, SMTP and POP3 to return the host
      string used for the connect.  This is useful to determine which host was
      connected to when multiple hosts are specified.
